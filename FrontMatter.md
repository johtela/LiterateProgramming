# Front Matter

All of the input files may contain a special block called _front matter_ 
at the very beginning of them. The front matter is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/)
block that contains metadata related to the input file or to the whole project.
It is a collection of string properties that is passed to the theme assembly 
for controlling the HTML generation.

Typically the front matter looks something like this:

    ---
    ProjectName: Literate Programming
    GitHub: https://github.com/johtela/LiterateProgramming
    Footer: Copyright (c) 2017 Tommi Johtela
    ShowDescriptionsInToc: true
    SyntaxHighlight: son-of-obsidian
    ---

It is delimited by three hyphens `---` and it must start on the first line of a 
markdown or C# file. No other text may appear before it, excluding the comment 
start token `/*` when it appears in a C# file.

## Default Settings

For some of the properties you probably want to set a same value for all files.
You don't need to duplicate these settings in every input file. Rather, define 
them in the `defaults.yml` file, so they will be processed before any of the 
input files are read. It is still possible to override properties on individual 
files, if you like.

The format of the `defaults.yml` file is exactly the same as for the front 
matter, except that you should not add the three hyphens `---` at the beginning 
and at the end. These are not part of YAML syntax.

## Available Properties

The list of available properties depends on the theme used. The properties 
available in the default theme are listed below. Property names and values 
are case-insensitive, so they can be typed using any convention: lowercase, 
uppercase, Camel case, Pascal case, etc.

### `Template` (string)

The name of the template used for producing the HTML page. This setting
is theme-dependent. In the default theme, the possible choices are:
* **Default** - Default template for documentation pages.
* **Landing** - Template for the landing page.

Depending on the template used, a property might be relevant or not. The list 
of supported parameters available in the default theme is shown in the table 
below. The columns indicate if a parameter is supported by a specific template.

### `UseDiagrams` (true/false)

Diagram support is off by default. This is because enabling it increases page 
loading times. If you want to include diagrams in your documentation, set this 
property to `true`. For more information refer to the
[Tips & Tricks](TipsAndTricks.html) page.

### `DiagramStyle` (string)

The name of CSS style file used by the [mermaid](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/)
diagramming library. The default theme includes all style files that

* **mermaid.dark** - A slightly darker blue theme.
* **mermaid.forest** - Green-colored theme.

### `UseMath` (true/false)

As with diagrams, support for mathematical formulas is disabled by default. The 
default theme uses the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) library to render
the formulas, and since it is a big library, loading it takes some time. To 
enable the math support, set this property to `true`. For more information refer 
to the [Tips & Tricks](TipsAndTricks.html) page.

### `_Jumbotron` (markdown)
The contents of the jumbotron pane of the landing page. All the parameters 
that start with underscore `_` will be translated to HTML automatically.
