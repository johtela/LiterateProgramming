		## Built-in Properties

		The rest of the properties defined in the PageParams class are updated 
		for	each generated page. These are page-level parameters which are always 
		available.

		The Root property gives the relative path from the page location to the
		root directory of the website. For example, if the page we are generating 
		resides under directory `source\code\`, then Root would contain path 
		`..\..\`. Say you want to add a link to another page which resides under 
		directory `doc\`. Now you can to refer to it by adding the value of	the 
		Root property at the beginning of the path. The resulting path would be 
		`..\..\doc\`.
		
		So, the Root property allows us to create relative links between pages
		that work regardless of where the site resides on disk.	This is 
		quite handy since now the links work correctly when pages are viewed
		locally from disk as well as when they are accessed from a web server.
		*/
		public string Root { get; set; }
		/*
		The name of the currently processed file is stored in the property
		below. The name does not include a file extension.
		*/
		public string Filename { get; set; }
		/*
		Perhaps the most important data passed to the theme is the contents
		of the page which is provided in the property below. The property
		contains the documentation extracted from the source file in HTML
		format. Typically the theme will just insert this in the appropriate
		place on a page.
		*/
		public string Contents { get; set; }
		/*
		### TOC Related Properties

		The table of contents object is accessible through the Toc property.
		This object is always initialized, even when the user does not provide
		a TOC file. In that case the TOC is empty, and there are no sections
		in it.
		*/
		public Toc Toc { get; set; }
		/*
		When a TOC file is provided, and the current page can be found in it,
		then the following property contains a reference to the Section object 
		we are on currently. This information can be used to highlight which 
		section	in the TOC we are viewing.
		*/
		public Section CurrentSection { get; set; }
		/*
		The SectionPath helper function returns the relative path to section in
		the TOC from the current page. It is handy in generating links to TOC. 
		The method also changes the source file path to a relative URL by
		changing the extension to "html" and replacing backslashes with
		forward slashes.
