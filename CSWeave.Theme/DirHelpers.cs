		## Miscellaneous Methods

		Testing if a value is in a specified set is usually done by a long and 
		repetitive `if` statement of the form:
			
			if (<variable> == <value1> || 
				<variable> == <value2> || 
				<variable> == <value3> || 
				...) 

		By using the extension method below the test simplifies to:

			if (<variable>.In (<value1>, <value2>, <value3>, ...))

		## Directory Related Methods

		The following method copies all subdirectories of a given input directory 
		to a target directory. **Note** that it only copies the directory structure,
		not the files inside those directories.
		
		You can specify a glob filter for the input directories. Only directories 
		with names matching the filter will be copied. If you want all the 
		directories copied, give `*` as the filter.
		
		You can	also specify with the `recurse` parameter whether the whole 
		directory tree is copied, or just the top level directories.
