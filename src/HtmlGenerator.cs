# HTML Generation

The last piece of the HTML related functionality is the HtmlGenerator class 
which is accountable for the following tasks:

* Loading the theme.
* Parsing the front matter of an input file and passing its parameters to the 
  theme.
* Converting documentation blocks and markdown files to HTML.
* Rendering the page using the theme.

This might seem like lot of work but actually most of the steps outlined above
are delegated to other libraries. Parsing the front matter is performed using
the [YamlDotNet](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet) library. 
[Markdig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig) library takes care of converting
markdown to HTML. References to the corresponding namespaces can be found below.
