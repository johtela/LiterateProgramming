# Splitting Files into Blocks

The task of the block builder is to extract a block list from a source file. 
We use a simple regular expression to split markdown files into blocks, but with 
C# files we utilize a more sophisticated tool: the [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) 
compiler platform. Roslyn comprises a set of libraries and APIs that expose all 
facets of the C# compiler: lexer, parser, type checker, code generator, and so on. 
This is the same compiler that is used by Visual Studio and other official Microsoft 
tools, so it should be always complete and up-to-date.

We need only the parser to separate documentation and code, but we can take 
advantage of other parts of Roslyn too. For example, we can use the semantic analysis
to distinguish which identifiers represent types and highlight them in the output 
as Visual Studio does. We can also get the type information of any expression
and show it in a tooltip window.

The semantic information is useful only in conjunction with HTML output, though. 
In markdown we cannot make use of it, mostly because the code blocks cannot be 
augmented with styling information. Even if there was a way to add metadata to 
code blocks, any of the markdown-to-HTML converters would not probably use it. 
Consequently, we defer utilizing the semantic information to the 
[HtmlBlockBuilder](HtmlBlockBuild.html) class which is used in context of HTML 
output.

So, let's tackle the parsing problem first, and see how it is performed by 
the BlockBuilder class.
