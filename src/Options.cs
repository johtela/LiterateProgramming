# Command Line Options & Usage

`csweave` is a console tool and it is controlled primarily through command line options. 
[Command Line Parser Library](https://commandline.codeplex.com/) is used to parse the options. It
simplifies the process and allows us to define new parameters just by adding properties to the 
Option class.

		### Filters for Source Files
		The arguments given without an option specifiers `-` or `--` are assumed to be filters 
		that specify what files are processed by the tool. You can give multiple filters or file 
		names to be searched for. The filters may contain literal text and three kinds of 
		wildcards that conform to the _glob_ convention:

		 -	`?` matches a single character.
		 -	`*` matches zero or more occurrences of any character except `\`. So, this wild card 
			basically matches a part of a file or a directory name.
		 -	`**` matches zero or more occurrences of any character including the backslash. This 
			wildcard can be used to select files that reside in subdirectories.

		The file names that are matched against the filters are given relative either to the 
		input folder or to the solution folder.

		spaces or tabs that appear in the source file. If not trimmed, these lines will be

		## Split File Paths
		In order to make reading and parsing of the file and directory paths simpler, we will	
		define few helper properties that present them as [SplitPath](SplitPath.html) 
		structures. The idea behind this data type is explained on its own documentation page, 
		but in a nutshell its main purpose is to separate the two parts of a file path: the 
		absolute base path and the relative file path. Doing this makes the code that needs 
		these paths more succinct and readable. It also makes mapping the paths to hyperlinks 
		easier. 

		The files produced by `csweave` are stored in a similar directory hierarchy as the 
		input files. The base directory for the input files is defined by the `-i` option, or 
		if a solution file is provided (with the `-s` option), the base input directory will
		be the one where the solution file resides. If neither is given, the current directory
		is used as the base input path.

		Lastly, the theme path is constructed. The base path of the theme is the directory
		where the theme DLL resides. If the theme path given as an option is not an absolute
		one, it is assumed that the path points to a folder under the application directory
		(where the executables reside).	By default, these files reside under the directory	
		'_applicationDirectory_\Themes', each theme in its own subdirectory.

## Usage Examples
Below are some example command lines for the most common usage scenarios.

### Create Markdown Output

The following command line processes all C# and markdown files in a solution 
(including all projects and subfolders), and generates markdown output to a 
directory called "docs". It also includes the `-t` switch to strip the indentation 
from the comments. This setting is usually on.
```
csweave **.cs **.md -s <solution>.sln -o docs -f md -t
```

### Create HTML Output from Files in a Directory

The example below scans the subfolder "src" for C# files, and the root folder 
for markdown files. It produces HTML and outputs information to console for
each processed file (verbose option).

**Note 1:** If you use the `-i` switch to specify the input folder, and you want 
to process any subfolders under it, you must include the `-r` option to recursively 
scan them. Specifying the subfolder in the filters is not enough.

**Note 2:** Since we are just reading individual files C# files inside a directory
and do not provide a solution file, `csweave` cannot use Roslyn to compile the
code and produce semantic information. So, the syntax highlighting is limited
to basic tokens, and the links and type information is not available in the 
produced HTML files.
```
csweave src\*.cs *.md -i <root> -r -o docs -f html -t -v
```

### Create HTML Output for a Solution

The last example uses all the available functionality. It produces documentation
for the `csweave` tool itself. It specifies the solution file, and filters out
C# files under "src" and "CSWeave.Theme" subdirectories, along with the markdown
files under the solution directory.

Table of contents file is updated while the files are processed. This is specified
with the `-u` switch.

```
csweave src\*.cs CSWeave.Theme\*.cs *.md -s ..\..\LiterateProgramming.sln -o ..\..\docs -f html -t -v -u
```

**Tip:** If you think the command line above is a bit dense, you can also use the 
long format for the options to make them more understandable. The options are 
case-insensitive, so you can write them in any way you like.

```
csweave src\*.cs CSWeave.Theme\*.cs *.md --Solution ..\..\LiterateProgramming.sln --Output ..\..\docs --Format html --Trim --Verbose --UpdateTOC
```
