# TOC Manager

Although the TOC data structure is defined in the [CSWeave.Theme](../CSWeave.Theme/Toc.html) 
assembly, the code that loads and saves TOC can be found here, under the TocManager class. 
Themes only need to read the table of contents; loading and updating it is handled by the 
main application.

## Dependencies

TocManager is a helper class that groups together the functionality related 
to the file format and serialization. It uses [YamlDotNet](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet)
library to parse and deserialize the TOC file. The format of the file is described
on a [separate page](../TableOfContents.html).

		When a TocManager is created, a filename and the actual Toc object are
		provided. These are kept in private fields for the other methods to access. 
		If new sections are added, they are be kept in a separate list to keep the 
		Toc	object immutable during the operation of the program.

		## Adding New Sections

		Instead of adding a new entry to TOC while the documentation is being
		generated, we add it to a temporary list. This list is concatenated
		to the TOC before it is saved. If there is no file associated to the 
		TOC (in which case the temporary list is null), then we don't need to

		## Saving TOC

		We could use the serialization functionality of YamlDotNet to write the TOC
		back to a file, but it is actually simpler just add the new entries as text.
		Serialization has its own quirks which we should work around, if we would
		like to use it. The new entries are always at the end of the file, so we
		can just open the file in the append mode and write the sections into it.

		recursively. The function below does just that. If a given file is not found
