# Document Weaver

The main workhorse of the application is the weaver. It enumerates the source 
files as specified by command line options and generates documentation for each 
file separately.

The Weaver class is abstract, and the actual documentation generation is
delegated to its subclasses. There are two subclasses for the two output
formats: [MdWeaver](MdWeaver.html) for markdown and [HtmlWeaver](HtmlWeaver.html) 
for HTML.

Let's first look at the base class which contains code common to both weavers.

## Dependencies
We utilize a couple of libraries provided by Microsoft to access MSBuild 
solution and project files. The first one resides in the `Microsoft.Build.*`
assemblies. They contain classes and methods for manipulating MS Build solution
files; to open a solution, enumerate the files in it, get the build 
configurations, and so on. 

The other important dependency is the [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)
compiler platform. The assemblies related to that lay under the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.*`
namespace. Weaver needs to reference the namespaces to access their types, but 
doesn't really use them. More involved code related to Roslyn and solution compilation 
is separated to the helper class [MSBuildHelpers](MSBuildHelpers.html). Weaver tries 
to keep things simple by working on the higher abstraction level.
