# Working with MSBuild Files

Loading and compiling a solution with Roslyn involves quite a lot of steps
making the task somewhat complicated. Therefore, we encapsulate the complex 
stuff to a static helper class that hides the intermediate steps.

**Side note:** I am not entirely sure that the way we are managing project
references is the preferred approach. The documentation of Roslyn and especially
[MSBuildWorkspace](http://www.coderesx.com/roslyn/html/334B7980.htm) is really 
lacking on this topic. Anyhow, the current implementation is the only way I 
could get the assembly references at least mostly working. The compiler still
complains about missing references, but the semantic information seems to be
available nevertheless.
