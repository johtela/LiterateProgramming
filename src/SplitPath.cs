# SplitPath Structure

`csweave` operates with three base directories:

* input directory which contains the files to be processed,
* output directory where the generated documentation will be placed, and
* theme directory which stores the HTML rendering library and its auxiliary files.

When accessing files in these directories it is often necessary to segregate
the base directory and the relative path inside that directory. For this purpose, 
we define a helper data structure that encapsulates a file path, but stores it in 
two parts: base path and file path. We call this data structure SplitPath and 
define it as follows.

		## Two Parts of SplitPath

		One benefit of splitting a path is that we can make sure that the parts
		are always in correct format. The base part is extended so that it contains 
		an absolute folder path, and it is ensured that the last character is a 
		backslash. Conversely, the file path is checked to be relative path without 
		a root folder. If that is not the case, the constructor throws an exception.

		## Constructing a SplitPath

		There is a handful of constructor methods that help building a 
		SplitPath in various ways.

		First of all, it is possible to create a partial SplitPath by omitting 
		either part of the path. Partial paths can be later glued together to 
		create a valid path. The following two methods create a SplitPath given 
		either just a base path or a file path.

		create the relative file path.

		are in a file path, thus returning its depth.

		(`../`) together as the depth of the file path indicates to construct
		a relative path to the base directory.
